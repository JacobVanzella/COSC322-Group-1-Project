# Game of Amazon AI
### A Minimax based AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning for playing the Game of Amazons on a 10x10 board.

In this gradle project an alpha-beta pruning minimax algorithm is implemented to play against other players or against other AI.\
The AI searches a board state and scores moves based on a simple moves available heuristic.\
The AI also has a built in validity check for each of the opponents moves to alert the game server if an illegal move is made.\
